## Last Stand
Last Stand is a modification for the game *Natural Selection 2* introducing a new game mode.

Last Stand was originally created in a game jam of Unknown Worlds Entertainment.

### Design Goals

Last Stand is intended to trim *Natural Selection 2* down to a faced-paced shooter focusing at direct combat.

In that matter all commander or other strategical game elements have been removed.

Marine's only objective is to survive a short amount of time while aliens try to kill all marines in given time.

Marines start fully upgraded with the possibility to buy/gather extra equipment before the round starts.

Alien start with their basic life form and get more resources to evolve into higher lifeforms as the round processes.
